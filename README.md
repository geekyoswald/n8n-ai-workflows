# 🧩 n8n Automation Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my automation workflows built using **n8n**.  
As a full-stack developer expanding into workflow automation and AI-driven integrations, I use n8n to create:

- Event-driven automations  
- SaaS integrations (Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Sheets, etc.)  
- Data processing and transformation pipelines  
- Developer productivity automations  

Each workflow in this repository is organized in its own folder and includes:
- The exported `workflow.json` (safe – no secrets included)  
- A brief README describing its purpose and logic  
- Optional screenshots or diagrams  

This structure allows the repository to grow as I create more automations over time.
